# Expansion Bay

The expansion bay is a slot on the back of the Framework 16 that allows for upgrades, mainly for cooling or the option for a dedicated GPU.

## Options

By default, the Framework 16 (shortened to FW16), comes with a module which sits flush with the back of the machine, and prioritizes cooling. Optionally, you can replace this with a dedicated GPU, which gives the user additional graphics processing. At the time of writing (9/28/2023), the only option is an AMD Radeon RX 7700S, though more options will come. 

## Technical Details
### Expansion Bay

The Expansion Bay has a custom edge connector with a PCIe 8x interface, with holes to pass through to the cooling system.

### Expansion Bay Shell

The Expansion Bay Shell, which comes stock with the FW16, contains an interface to connect to the laptop, and contains 2 75mm x 8.2mm Cooler Master fans. It draws power from the PCIe 8x interface [[1]](https://frame.work/products/laptop16-diy-amd-7040?tab=modules). With this module, the width of the laptop is 17.95mm [[2]](https://frame.work/products/laptop16-diy-amd-7040?tab=specs). The shell also gives room for development for custom modules, an example provided by framework being a dual SSD expansion [[3]](https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/ExpansionBay).

### Graphics Module 

The Graphics Module, at time of writing, contains an AMD Radeon RX 7700S, with 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM, a 100W TGP, and 2 Cooler Master fans being the same as the ones contained in the shell [[4]](https://frame.work/products/laptop16-diy-amd-7040?tab=modules). The module increases the length of the laptop to 290.2mm and increases the thickness to 20.95mm [[5]](https://frame.work/products/laptop16-diy-amd-7040?tab=specs).
