# Expansion Bay

The Expansion Bay is a custom slot on the back of [Framework Laptop 16](/framework-laptop-16).

## Cooling
The expansion bay contains the cooling fans for Framework laptop 16. For this reason, an expansion bay module must be installed whenever the laptop is in use. 

## First-Party Options
By default, Framework Laptop 16 comes with the Expansion Bay Shell, which only includes system cooling in the form of two 75mm x 8.2mm Cooler Master fans. With this module, the width of the laptop is 17.95mm [^2].

Users can replace the default Expansion Bay Shell with a dedicated GPU for more graphics-heavy workloads. At the time of writing, the only option is an AMD Radeon RX 7700S, though more options will come. [[citation-needed]](/framewiki:citation-needed) The AMD Radeon RX 7700S module includes 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM, a 100W TGP, and 2 Cooler Master fans --- the same as the ones included in the Expansion Bay Shell [^4]. The module increases the length of the laptop to 290.2mm and increases the thickness to 20.95mm/ [^5]

## Technical Details
The Expansion Bay interface uses a custom connector that includes power and signaling for 8-lane PCIe, DisplayPort input and control for the internal display. [^3]
