# Framework Next Level Event
{% include sidecar.html %}
The **Framework Next Level Event** was a launch event held March 23, 2023 in San Francisco, California and livestreamed to the public on Framework's YouTube channel. [^1]

## Framework Laptop 13 Updates
During the event, hosted by CEO Nirav Patel, [Framework](/framework-computer-inc) announced two new [Framework Laptop 13](/products/framework-laptop-13) generations: [13th Gen Intel Core](/framework-laptop-13/13th-gen) and [AMD 7040 Series](/framework-laptop-13/7040-series), the first and currently only generation of AMD Ryzen mainboards for Framework Laptop 13.

The company also announced updates to the Framework Laptop 13's other parts, including a 61 Wh battery, present in laptops shipping with 13th Gen Intel Core i7 and AMD 7040 Series Ryzen 7 processors; a matte display; a second generation hinge to address display wobble and weight tolerence issues; and a translucent bezel option.

### Cooler Master Mainboard Case
Framework worked with Cooler Master to design and manufacture a small-form-factor case for Framework Laptop 13 mainboards, priced at $39. They released CAD files for a 3D-printable case with the launch of [12th Gen Intel Core](/products/framework-laptop-13/12th-gen) the previous year.

## Framework Laptop 16
Framework announced [Framework Laptop 16](/products/framework-laptop-16) toward the end of the event, with preorders slated to open in Spring 2023 and shipping later in the year.[^2]

They did not share the system's specifications, but they made documentation about the [expansion bay](/expansion-bay) and [input module](/input-modules) systems available for community developers to design custom parts ahead of the product's launch.[^3]

### Audio Expansion Card
They also announced the audio expansion card to go with the new product, which does not have a built-in headphone jack.[^1] "It really comes down to one word: courage. The courage to move on and do something new that betters all of us," Patel said, met by laughter from the in-person audience.[^5] Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller used an identical line when announcing that iPhone 7 would not have a headphone jack.[^4]

## Concepts
Framework showed off two proof-of-concept accessories to enable reuse of other newly-announced parts:

### Battery Enclosure
One concept product was a case for Framework Laptop 13's 55- or 61-Wh batteries that allowed them to act as a USB-C power bank.[^6] They announced it alongside publishing documentation about the battery's connector for community developers.[^7]

### eGPU
To demonstrate the reusability of expansion bay graphics modules, they also showed an enclosure that allows them to work as an eGPU over Thunderbolt or USB 4.[^6]

## Region Expansions
Framework announced plans to expand availability to Belgium, Taiwan, Italy and Spain "later in 2023."[^2]
