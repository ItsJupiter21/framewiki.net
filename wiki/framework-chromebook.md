# Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition
{% include sidecar.html %}

**Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition** was a variant of [Framework Laptop 13](/framework-laptop-13) developed in partnership with Google to run ChromeOS.[^1] It was announced September 21, 2022, with pre-orders opening the same day. Devices began shipping in December of that year.

The Chromebook was built on the Framework Laptop 13 chassis. The pre-built featured an Intel Core i5-1240P CPU, 8GB of DDR4-3200 and 256GB of storage. No DIY Edition was available.[^2] Framework did not release any subsequent generations before discontinuing the Chromebook line in August 2024.

Framework posted a knowledgebase article on August 26, 2024 explaining how to convert a Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition to a Framework Laptop 13. The article includes an exception to the company's normal practice of not commenting on future plans by stating that they "donâ€™t currently have plans for a newer generation of Framework Laptop 13 Chromebook Edition."
