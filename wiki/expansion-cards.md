# Expansion Cards
Expansion Cards are custom form factor USB-C adapters that enable customizable and hot-swappable I/O on Framework laptops. The cards lock into Expansion Card Bays on [Framework Laptop 13](/framework-laptop-13) and [Framework Laptop 16](/framework-laptop-16).

Expansion Cards are standard USB-C adapters, so they can be used with any host device that supports the applicable parts of the USB-C specification. [[1]](https://community.frame.work/t/expansion-cards-compatible-with-other-devices/990/2?u=morpheus636)
