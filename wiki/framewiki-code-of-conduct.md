# Framewiki: Code of Conduct
## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Persistent violation of Framewiki's content standards, including spam and vandalism
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Framewiki's administrative board is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. The administrative board has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Process
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to Framewiki's administrative board via email to `admin@framewiki.net`. Complaints sent to the board will be assigned to an individual administrator, who will promptly and fairly investigate any complaints they receive, and impose sanctions in accordance with the enforcement guidelines.

The assigned administrator must give all involved parties 7 days to present argument and evidence before imposing final sanctions. They may grant temporary sanctions while the reply is pending if doing so would be in the community's best interest and the case is likely to succeed on its merits. If the individual administrator is unable to make a decision, they may refer the complaint to the administrative board.

If administrators find wrongdoing, a docket will be posted publicly containing relevant communications and arguments from the parties, as well as any decisions and findings of fact. If no wrongdoing is found, a final report will be sent privately to all involved parties.

The identity of the complainant will not be included in the docket or final report. However, names of involved parties cannot be kept confidential because it is often impossible to redact identities while providing enough detail for accused parties to respond to an allegation. **Harassment of any involved party by any means constitutes separate violation of this Code of Conduct and will result in additional sanctions.**

Decisions of an individual administrator are subject to appeal to the whole administrative board, which acts as Framewiki's court of last resort. The appellant must submit a petition for appeal containing their argument. If the petition is accepted, other involved parties will be given 7 days to respond before the board makes a decision. The board may, by a majority vote, affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or dismiss the appeal as improvidently granted.


## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the appropriate sanctions for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
