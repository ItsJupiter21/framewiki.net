# Framewiki: Contributing
To contribute to Framewiki, you'll need to have a GitHub account. Framewiki is written in Markdown and deployed via GitHub Pages. By contributing, you agree to license your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license. For more information, see [Framewiki: Copyright](/framewiki:copyright).

To edit an existing page, click the Edit button at the top right of any page to begin editing. If you don't already have one, GitHub will prompt you to create a fork, which is where you will make your edits. Be sure your edits comply with [Framewiki's content standards](/framewiki:guidelines). 

Once you've made your changes and committed them, open a Pull Request into `framewiki/framewiki.net:main`, which is the production branch from which Framewiki is automatically built and deployed. **Your changes will be deployed automatically by the system when you open a pull request,** unless they include changes to [protected](/framewiki:protection) parts of the wiki.

## Formatting
For information on the basic Markdown syntax, see this [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

Framewiki includes support for additional formatting, including [citations](/framewiki:citations), [notes](/framewiki:notes) and [sidecars](/framewiki:sidecars). All editors should be familiar with [citations](/framewiki:citations), as they are required to comply with Framewiki's [verifiability guidelines](/framewiki:guidelines#verifiability). 

Being familiar with the other concepts may be helpful, but knowledge of them is not strictly necessary for most edits.

## Getting Involved
If you are looking for ways to contribute to Framewiki, here are a few ways to start:

- Look for red links, which indicate that an article does not yet exist, and [create them](/framewiki:guidelines#creating-pages! Lists, such as [Guides](/guides) and [products](/products) are a good place to look.
- Add [sidecars](/framewiki:sidecars) to non-meta pages that do not already have them.
- Add a cover image to [sidecars](/framewiki:sidecars) on product pages that do not already have one. Be sure you have the rights to any images you upload.
- Look for [[citation needed]](/framewiki:citation-needed) tags and try to locate a source to support or refute the claim.
- Add [archive links](/framewiki:citations#archive-links) to any [citations](/framewiki:citations) that lack them. This is especially important where the links are already broken.
- Expand short articles that have been marked as stubs, or help write articles that are marked work in progress.

If you have major improvements you'd like to make to Framewiki, consider [submitting an RFC](/framewiki:governance#decision-making-process) to get community input.
