## Information Collected via Framewiki
### GitHub Pages
Framewiki is hosted on GitHub Pages. When you visit Framewiki, GitHub logs and stores your IP address for security purposes, regardless of whether or not you are logged into GitHub. GitHub does not make this information available to Framewiki. For more information, see the [GitHub Pages data collection statement](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection).

### GitHub
Framewiki contributions and discussions are submitted via GitHub using your GitHub account. Framewiki does not store GitHub usernames, emails, or any other user data outside of GitHub. GitHub's data collection and use of your data is subject to the [GitHub Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)

### Giscus
Framewiki's discussion section uses Giscus. Giscus does not collect any personal information. When you sign into GitHub via the discussion section on Framewiki, you authorize Giscus to post discussion comments on your behalf using the GitHub OAuth flow. If you do not wish to authorize Giscus to post on your behalf, you can use GitHub Discussions directly at [framewiki/framewiki.net/discussions](https://github.com/framewiki/framewiki.net/discussions). For more information, see the [Giscus Privacy Policy](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/blob/main/PRIVACY-POLICY.md).

### Plausible Analytics
Framewiki uses a self-hosted instance of Plausible Analytics to understand traffic and prioritize work on the site. Plausible does not collect personal data, store cookies, or track users individually. All analytics data is aggregated and publicly available at <https://metrics.framewiki.net/framewiki.net>

The web server that runs Plausible logs the IP address, User-Agent, URL path and timestamp associated with each request for security purposes. This information is not shared with any third party and is deleted when server logs are rotated. The server does not log any other contents of the associated request or associate the logged information with any other data, including analytics data.

## Cookies and Tracking
Framewiki does not use tracking cookies or track individual users. 

When you sign into GitHub via the discussion section on Framewiki, Giscus will store a server-encrypted API token in your browser. On every subsequent load of Framewiki, the token will be decrypted by the Giscus server to let you create authenticated requests to the GitHub Discussions API.

## GDPR/CCPA Right to Access and Deletion
Framewiki does not have any data to provide or delete upon request.
